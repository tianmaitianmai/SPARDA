# Note

Our previously written traditional image processing algorithms using MATLAB can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPbpafUmi_k2XkBb4anzdZOXEnZHR12N/view?usp=share_link), with its `sha256sum` as `59085ffc06d2a9f642204e4871a31e7133e444fffc4e50a8567a0cb61620f4ed`.
As maintaining the previous image processing algorithms is not the purpose of this repository, we have chosen to archive the MATLAB code and share it from the cloud with GPL licence.
